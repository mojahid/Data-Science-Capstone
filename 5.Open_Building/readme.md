# Google Open Building 

As per [Google Open Building research website](https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/), this large-scale open dataset contains the outlines of buildings 
derived from high-resolution satellite imagery in order to support these types of uses. The project being based in Ghana, the current focus is on the continent of Africa.  

For each building in this dataset we include the polygon describing its footprint on the ground, a confidence score indicating how sure we are that this is a building, 
and a Plus Code corresponding to the centre of the building. There is no information about the type of building, its street address, or any details other than its geometry.

The following shows a snapshot of the data that can be donwloaded from Google Open Building website.

Google offers also a hybrid map option through Google Earth Enginer to overlay the building on the high resolution map:
