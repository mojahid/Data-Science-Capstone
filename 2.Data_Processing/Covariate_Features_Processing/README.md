This python file contains the code used to extract and processing of all covariate features. Initally, all covariate features were extracted for each labeled data point. The extraction output in the form of one column. Each column contained 61 values in a string structure. Therefore, further processing was conducted to have an output ready for modeling. This file outputs one csv containing the labeled data and 61 covariate features columns. 

     
## project_root:
