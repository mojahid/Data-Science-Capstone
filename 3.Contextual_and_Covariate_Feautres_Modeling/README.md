# Contextual Features Modeling

This section contains three folders: 
  1) Code - the analysis for the contextual and covariate features
  2) Results - model results for the contextual features
  3) feature_selection - contains two folders 'Contextual' and 'Covariate'. Each folder stores the five different feature importance methods
  4) Saved Models - All saved trained models for contextual and covariate features.

# Note
To run code in the correct order, refer to Read me file on 'Mapping-Deprive-Areas-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks' section 'Steps for Processing and Running Covariate and Contextual feature Importance and Modeling'
