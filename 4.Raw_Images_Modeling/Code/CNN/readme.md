# Using the code

The code files here are separated from each other and each is performing a separate task.

1. **Modeling_CNN.py** will build a CNN model based on raw image data (can also be used for open building generated images)
2. **Pretrained_Model.py** will build a CNN model based on VGG16 pre-trained model (can also be used for open building generated images)
3. **CNN_GridSearch.py** and **Keras_Tuner_CNN.py** is an exploration of Grid Search and Keras Tuner to test different model parameters and find the optimum configuration
4. **Slice_Coordinates.py** can be used to build a csv file based on the prediction of any model. This can be used to add a layer in any GIS software and overlay the prediction
