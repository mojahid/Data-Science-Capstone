# Autoencoder 

An Autoencoder is an unsupervised learning neural network. It is primarily used for learning data compression and inherently learns an identity function. First introduced in the 1980s, it was promoted in a paper by Hinton & Salakhutdinov in 2006. An Autoencoder network aims to learn a generalized latent representation ( encoding ) of a dataset. Autoencoder is helpful in various domains, such as for processing image, text, and audio.
