Mapping Deprived Areas in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC)

*The goal of this project is to develop a methodology to map of deprived areas using a range of geospatial data at
approximately 100m grid cells. 

Week (01/24 - 02/29):
* Met with different stakeholders to acquire and understand data

Week (01/31 - 02/04):
* Generated code to extract coordinates and labels of areas of study from the training data
* Generated code to extract images corresponding to the coordinates of the area of study 

Week (02/07 - 02/11):
* Working on code clip TIFF images using the Training map and Row map

Week (02/14 - 02/18):
* Generated code to convert TIFF images into PNG format to be use for modeling

Week (02/21 - 02/25):
* Presidentsâ€™ Day

Week (02/28 - 03/04):
* Working on image augmentation to add more images to unbalanced class images
